# Libras ðŸ¤Ÿ

This repository aims to share a submission accepted for [WWDC2019 Scholarships](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/).

## Description

Nowadays, Brazil has only one town with Libras (Brazilian Sign Language) in its educational plan. Brazilâ€™s deficit on education and inclusive policies is well known, but the scholarship community, such as parents and volunteers, is making a great effort to make schools better.

The society is grounded on language, so is the language that allows us to express ourselves, understand the others and make us more humans. It is crucial that we should have the tools to communicate with each other. The Libras is not just a language for speech and hearing impaired persons, it is just another langue, like English, Portuguese and Spanish, it is another form of expression.

In this context, there is a lot of space for using technology in education and to bring people together. This Playground is a game with the intent to facilitate the learning of Librasâ€™s alphabet for children. The game consists that the player has to guess a letter of the imageâ€™s name/meaning through a keyboard constituted by Libras signs that represent the alphabet letters. The images used are emojis because its meaning is usually clear, easy to understand and represent a large part of daily life. Thus, this is a simple game as an exercise to children learn which sign represent each letter.

The real inclusion only happens when all society are involved in this process, and this process is not just educational but it is a social task.

Thanks, and enjoy.
